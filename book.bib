               vegetation biomes}",
  author    = "Skowno, Andrew L and Jewitt, Debbie and Slingsby, Jasper A",
  abstract  = "The loss of natural habitat resulting from human activities is
               the principal driver of biodiversity loss in terrestrial
               ecosystems globally. Metrics of habitat loss are monitored at
               national and global scales using various remote sensing based
               land-cover change products. The metrics go on to inform
               reporting processes, biodiversity assessments, land-use
               decision-making and strategic planning in the environmental and
               conservation sector. We present key metrics of habitat loss
               across South Africa at national and biome levels for the first
               time. We discuss the spatial patterns and trends, and the
               implications and limitations of the metrics. Approximately 22\%
               of the natural habitat of South Africa has been lost since the
               arrival of European settlers. The extent and the rate of habitat
               loss are not uniform across South Africa. The relatively mesic
               Grassland, Fynbos and Indian Ocean Coastal Belt biomes have lost
               the most habitat, while the arid Nama-Karoo, Succulent Karoo and
               Desert have lost the least. Rates of loss increased across all
               biomes in recent years (2014--2018), indicating that the
               historical drivers of change (i.e. expansion of croplands, human
               settlements, plantation forestry and mining) are intensifying
               overall. We should caution that the losses we report are
               conservative, because the land-cover change products do not
               capture degradation within natural ecosystems. Preventing
               widespread biodiversity losses and securing the benefits we
               derive from biodiversity requires slowing and preventing further
               habitat degradation and loss by using existing land-use planning
               and regulatory tools to their full potential.",

                  visualize and model geographic data with open source
                  software. It is based on R, a statistical programming
                  language that has powerful data processing, visualization,
                  and geospatial capabilities. The book equips you with the
                  knowledge and skills to tackle a wide range of issues
                  manifested in geographic data, including those with
                  scientific, societal, and environmental implications. This
                  book will interest people from many backgrounds, especially
                  Geographic Information Systems (GIS) users interested in
                  applying their domain-specific knowledge in a powerful open
                  source language for data science, and R users interested in
                  extending their skills to handle spatial data.",
