# Overview

_This is a minimal introduction to GIS and handling spatial data in R compiled for the Biological Sciences BSc(Honours) class at the University of Cape Town._


## General

The goal is to give you a very brief introduction to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in general and some familiarity with handling spatial data in R. GIS is a field of research that many people dedicate their entire lives to, yet we only have a week, so this really is a minimalist introduction. I'll focus on giving you a broad overview and some idea of how to teach yourself (using R).

The core outcomes I hope you'll come away with:

* Some familiarity with GIS and what it can help you achieve
* Some familiarity with GIS jargon and technical terms
* Highlight some of the common problems and pitfalls when using GIS
* Some familiarity with handling spatial data in R
* Some hints and resources to help you teach yourself R
* Some idea of how to help yourself or find help when you inevitably come unstuck...

## Using this resource {#using}

I've included quite a bit of demonstration R code in Chapter \@ref(rdemo). To tun the code you will need:

* to have working R and RStudio installations - [this](https://learnr-examples.shinyapps.io/ex-setup-r/) tutorial may help if needed
* to install the following R packages (you can copy and run the code):
  - required: `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "sp", "rgdal", "raster", "sf", "lwgeom"))`
  - optional, but handy for some visualizations: `install.packages(c("cowplot", "hrbrthemes", "knitr", "leaflet", "htmltools", "rosm", "ggspatial", "rnaturalearth"))`
* to download the datasets discussed in section \@ref(casestudy)

<br>

## Module and Project details

**Lectures** 

Lectures will be held in the mornings between 10:00 to 12:00 Monday to Thursday (Friday is presentation day - see below). We'll have 2 or 3 short live online lectures (I'll aim for <20 min each) with short breaks. You need to attend live (but remotely). The zoom link (see Vula) should stay the same for all lecture sessions. 

<br>

**Projects**

Afternoons are self-study time where you will incrementally develop your own individual GIS project in R and [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). The project will count 70% of your mark for the module and will be **due on Friday the 11th June**. You will need to submit a .Rmd file and stitched HTML notebook. 

The focus of the assignment is essentially setting up a GIS workflow and will be assessed on whether you've absorbed the content of the lectures. The topic and datasets used will be up to you. **Pro tip:** Use this as an opportunity to get a kick start on your Honours projects. If your Honours project doesn't require GIS then either help a buddy or let your curiosity roam wild! This is a teaching exercise, so it doesn't even have to be based on biological data, but it would help you to explore some of the data sources suggested below.

The project objectives, broken down as daily goals to help you pace yourselves:

* Day 1: Define a question that requires GIS, the kinds of data you'll need to address the question, and describe in words what you think you would need to do with the data to get there. You are welcome to use your Honours project for this and use it as an opportunity to get some GIS help!
* Day 2: Find and describe the datasets youâ€™ll need for your analysis (type, source, how created, etc).
* Day 3: Describe the GIS workflow you think you'll need to perform your analysis (in words and/or a figure) and the R functions you think you'll need to use.
* Day 4: Begin coding and running the GIS workflow in R.
* Until the 11th June: Iterate over the previous steps until done!

I will be available 2-3PM every afternoon (excluding Friday) as a "help desk" to assist you refine your projects and help troubleshoot issues.

**Friday (4th June):** you'll do lightning presentations (30% of your mark for the module) on your GIS projects (1 slide, 2 minutes presentation, 1 minute questions). Don't worry, you won't lose marks if your projects are not yet complete! We just want to know what you're doing your project on, what datasets you're using, and what you plan to do with them. Please add your slide to the Google slide deck and read the instructions there.
