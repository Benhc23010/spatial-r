# Overview

_This is a minimal introduction to GIS and handling spatial data in R compiled for the Biological Sciences BSc(Honours) class at the University of Cape Town._

The goal is to give you a very brief introduction to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in general and some familiarity with handling spatial data in R. GIS is a field of research that many people dedicate their entire lives to, yet we only have a week, so this really is a minimalist introduction. I'll focus on giving you a broad overview and some idea of how to teach yourself (using R).

The 5-day module includes daily ~1 hour lectures followed by self-study time where you will have daily goals/tasks to help you incrementally develop your own project. The project will be the deliverable for the module. I will be available for set office hours every afternoon to assist you.

_These course notes borrow or paraphrase extensively from [Adam Wilson's GEO 511 Spatial Data Science course](http://adamwilsonlabedu.github.io/GEO511/index.html) and [Manny Gimond's Intro to GIS & Spatial Analysis](https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/index.html)._ 

Other very valuable resources include:

* Lovelace et al's online book [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/)
* Ryan Garnett's [cheatsheet for library(sf)](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/sf.pdf)

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

The **bookdown** package can be installed from CRAN or Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.

To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.name/tinytex/>.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
