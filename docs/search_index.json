The goal is to give you a very brief introduction to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in general and some familiarity with handling spatial data in R. GIS is a field of research that many people dedicate their entire lives to, yet we only have a week, so this really is a minimalist introduction. I’ll focus on giving you a broad overview and some idea of how to teach yourself (using R). The 5-day module includes daily ~1 hour lectures followed by self-study time where you will have daily goals/tasks to help you incrementally develop your own project. The project will be the deliverable for the module. I will be available for set office hours every afternoon to assist you. These course notes borrow or paraphrase extensively from Adam Wilson’s GEO 511 Spatial Data Science course, Manny Gimond’s Intro to GIS &amp; Spatial Analysis and the 2020 series of GIS Lecture Lunches by Thomas Slingsby and Nicholas Lindenberg from UCT Library’s GIS Support Unit. Other very valuable resources include: Lovelace et al’s online book Geocomputation with R Ryan Garnett’s cheatsheet for library(sf) This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.
